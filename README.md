# Speedrun Retime Extension

## What does it do
This extension provides a simple interface to time speedruns on any website.

It offers video controls, including ones to step by just a single frame.

It is also possible to add "loads" for loading times, at the end you will be given the RTA and IGT of the run.

## How to use
1. Click on the extension icon. If it detects a video on the current page, there will be a "START" button. Click it to start the extension.

2. Once clicked, the extension will take a few seconds to measure the FPS of the video. Then you will be presented with a bar at the bottom of your browser window:<br/>

<br/>
The controls on the left side can start/stop the video, change the playback speed and skip ahead/go back by one frame.<br/>
Once the "START RUN" button is clicked, the starting frame of the run is set.

3. Once started, the bar will change slightly:<br/>

<br/>
The button "STOP RUN" will set the final frame of the run and show the resulting time.<br/>
"START LOADING" is used to set the first frame for a new loading time. Once clicked, the button will change to "STOP LOADING", which sets the final frame of the loading time. You can have as many loading times as you like.

4. Once stopped, the bar will look like this:<br/>

<br/>
Here you will see the RTA and IGT time of the run. If you clicked "STOP RUN" on accident, there's also a button to undo the operation.
